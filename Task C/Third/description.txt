In our first submission there is a csv file, called task_c.csv, containing our predictions on the test data made by using an LSTM network model. For this task we made use of some additional libraries which are tensorflow and sklearn. As configurations for our model, we went with a batch size of 71, a learning rate of 0.003, a dropout ratio 0.95, and an embedding size of 100. We preprocessed the data by lowercasing, removing hashtags and symbols that are not relevant for our classification system (e.g. digits, @, ", ' etc.). The weights for each of the three categories (IND), (GRP) and (OTH) were counted with respect to the number of representative tweets. As additional datasets we used an extra list of pronouns for identifying the IND group and 3 lists of top twitter usernames from Brazil, Spain, USA, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Germany and India, one for each of the three  categories.
